## JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator
----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description

Randomly generated passwords can enhance the security of sensitive data. To generate a random password, this website uses HTML to structure the layout, CSS to style content, and JavaScript to program the functional behavior. After collecting user preferences through a series of prompts, the password is generated based on specific criteria such as length, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special character types. Each prompt is validated after the selection, and the generated password that meets the selected criteria is displayed on the webpage.
